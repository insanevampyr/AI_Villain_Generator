✅ REVISED PLAN OF ACTION
PHASE 1: Gender Logic + Gender Balance Fix
✅ Step 1: Inject randomness into gender assignment
Add a gender field to the villain (randomly chosen: "male", "female", "nonbinary")

This ensures balanced outputs before GPT gets involved in describing them

✅ Step 2: Override with inferred gender from origin (if clear)
Check origin field for "he", "she" references — this can override the random gender

Keeps generated data consistent with language GPT uses

✅ Step 3: Use final gender in visual prompt generation
Prompt GPT to describe the villain visually as "a male/female/nonbinary villain"

Makes the visual prompt more cinematic and gender-appropriate

✅ Net Result: Balanced villain genders, consistent visuals, fewer weird mismatches

PHASE 2: Villain Logging to Google Sheets (on Download)
✅ Step 4: Only log villains on "Download Card" click
Keeps logs clean and intentional

No spam from multiple generations

✅ Step 5: Log the following to a Google Sheet:
Villain Name, Alias, Power, Weakness, Lair, Origin, etc.

Visual Prompt (if used)

Gender (assigned or inferred)

Timestamp

🔄 Bonus: Include a download link or placeholder for villain image (TBD where it’s hosted)

✅ Net Result: Trackable, reviewable villain database with clean audit trail for visuals and prompts

🚦Execution Order:
Gender Logic

Inject random gender per villain

Infer override from origin field

Pass gender into visual prompt generation

Test balance (male/female/NB)

Logging System

Set up Google Sheet with headers

Connect Streamlit to Google Sheets

Trigger logging on “Download Card” click

Solve image handling (hosted URL or encoded image)

🔥 AI Villain Generator – Cost-Safe Action Plan
✅ Phase 1: Cost-Protected AI Image Flow
 Limit users to 1 free AI portrait generation

 Add cookie-based tracker (non-auth, survives session)

 Add Paywall popup after 1 use

 Offer 2 AI generations per $1

 Support via: BuyMeACoffee + PayPal + Sponsor CTA

 Add DEV BYPASS via hidden toggle or key

✅ Phase 2: Cost Shield for Devs
 Skip GPT-3.5 visual prompt call if OpenAI free tier exhausted

 Show fallback visual description

 Save prompt for logging only if image was actually generated

🔜 Phase 3: Payment Validation (Later)
Store # of paid generations per user (basic ID or email)

Consume generation credits if available
